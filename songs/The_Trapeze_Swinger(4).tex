\lyrics
Pl\C{C}ease, remember m\C{G}e, happi\C{F5}ly
By the r\C{C}osebush l\C{G}aughing
With br\C{C}uises on my \C{G}chin, the time w\C{F5}hen
We counted e\C{C}very black car p\C{G}assing
Your h\C{Am}ouse beneath the h\C{G}ill
And up un\C{F5}til someone ca\C{C}ught us in the kit\C{G}chen
With \C{Am}maps, a mountain ra\C{G}nge, a piggy b\C{F5}ank
A vision t\C{C}oo removed to m\C{G}ention

But please, remember me, fondly
I heard from someone you're still pretty
And then they went on to say
That the pearly gates
Had some eloquent graffiti
Like ``We'll meet again'' and ``Fuck the man''
And ``Tell my mother not to worry''
And angels with their great handshakes
Were always done in such a hurry

And please, remember me, that Halloween
Making fools of all the neighbors
Our faces painted white
By midnight, we'd forgotten one another
And when the morning came I was ashamed
Only now it seems so silly
That season left the world and then returned
And now you're lit up by the city

So please, remember me, mistakenly
In the window of the tallest tower
Calling passers-by but much too high
To see the empty road at happy hour
Gleam and resonate, just like the gates
Around the holy kingdom
With words like ``Lost and found'' and ``Don't look down''
And ``Someone save temptation''
\continue
And please, remember me, as in the dream
We had as rug-burned babies
Among the fallen trees and fast asleep
Aside the lions and the ladies
That called you what you like and even might
Give a gift for your behavior
A fleeting chance to see a trapeze
Swinger high as any savior

But please, remember me, my misery
And how it lost me all I wanted
Those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains
The colored birds above their running
In circles around the well and where it spells
On the wall behind St. Peter
So bright, on cinder gray, in spray paint
``Who the hell can see forever?''

And please, remember me, seldomly
In the car behind the carnival
My hand between your knees, you turned from me
And said, ``The trapeze act was wonderful
But never meant to last'', the clown that passed
Saw me just come up with anger
When it filled with circus dogs, the parking lot
Had an element of danger

So please, remember me, finally
And all my uphill clawing
My dear, but if I make the pearly gates
I'll do my best to make a drawing
Of God and Lucifer, a boy and girl
An angel kissing on a sinner
A monkey and a man, a marching band
All around a frightened trapeze swinger
