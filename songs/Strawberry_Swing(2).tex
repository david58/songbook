They were \C{C}sitting
They were \C{G}sitting in the strawberry \C{D}swing
Every moment was so \C{C}precious \C{G D}

They were sitting
They were talking in the strawberry swing
Everybody was for fighting
Wouldn't wanna waste a thing

Cold, cold \C{C}water
Bring me \C{G}round
Now my \C{D}feet won't touch the \C{Em}ground
\C{C}Cold, cold water
What ya \C{G}say?
It's \C{Bm}such
It's such a perfect \C{C}day
It's \C{(Am)}such a perfect \C{G}day

I remember
We were walking up to strawberry swing
I can't wait 'til the morning
Wouldn't wanna change a thing

People moving all the time
Inside a perfectly straight line
Don't you wanna just curve away
When it's such
When it's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

\C{Am Em Am C} ahh...

Now the \C{G}sky could be \C{Bm}blue
I don't \C{G7}mind
\C{C}{Without} you it's a waste of time

Now the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time
\continue
Now the sky could be blue
Could be grey
Without you I'm just miles away

Now the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time
