\C{A}Look at the stars
Look how they shine \C{E}{for} you
And everything you \C{Dsus2}{do}
Yeah, they were all yellow

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called yellow

So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow\C{A Asus4 A}

I jumped across \C{E}{for} you
Oh, what a thing to \C{Dsus2}{do}
