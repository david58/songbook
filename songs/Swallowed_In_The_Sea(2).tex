You \C{B}cut me down a \C{F\guitarSharp}tree
And \C{E}brought it back to \C{B}me
And \C{A\guitarFlat m}that's what made me \C{F\guitarSharp}see
Where \C{E}I was going \C{B}wrong
You put me on a \C{F\guitarSharp}shelf
And \C{E}kept me for your\C{B}self
I can \C{A\guitarFlat m}only blame \C{F\guitarSharp}{myself}
You \C{E}can only blame \C{B}me\smallskip

And \C{E}I could write a \C{B}song
A \C{A\guitarFlat m}hundred miles \C{F\guitarSharp}long
Well, \C{E}that's where I be\C{B}long
And \C{A\guitarFlat m}you belong to \C{F\guitarSharp}me
And \C{E}I could write it \C{B}down
Or \C{A\guitarFlat m}spread it all a\C{F\guitarSharp}round
Get \C{E}lost and then get \C{B}found
Or \C{A\guitarFlat m}swallowed in the \C{F\guitarSharp}sea \C{B}\smallskip

You put me on a line
And hung me out to dry
And darling that's when I
Decided to go to see you

You cut me down to size
And opened up my eyes
Made me realize
What I could not see

And I could write a book
The one they'll say that shook
The world, and then it took
It took it back from me

And I could write it down
Or spread it all around
Get lost and then get found
And you'll come back to me
Not swallowed in the sea

%(Instrumental: C#m-E-B-F# (4X) )

And I could write a song
A hundred miles long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me

The streets you're walking on
A thousand houses long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me

Oh what good is it to live
With nothing left to give
Forget but not forgive
Not loving all you see

Oh the streets you're walking on
A thousand houses long
Well that's where I belong
And you belong with me
Not \C{E}swallowed in the \C{B}sea

\C{A\guitarFlat m}You belong with \C{F\guitarSharp}me
Not \C{E}swallowed in the \C{B}sea
Yeah, \C{A\guitarFlat m}you belong with \C{B}me
Not \C{E}swallowed in the \C{B}sea
