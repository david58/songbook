\C{Gadd9}I could try you with a waltz
\C{Em}I could try you rock and roll
\C{D}I could try you with the blues
\C{Am}If a song would do
\C{Gadd9}I could sing it high or low
\C{Em}When I let you go you know
I \C{D}thought it was \C{C}for the best
\C{D}Now it is so \C{C}obvious\smallskip

So \C{Gadd9}here it is, here it \C{D}goes
\C{Em}I could try rock and \C{G/B}roll
I would \C{Cadd9}change your
life for\C{G/B}ever too
\C{Am}If a song could \C{D}get me you
\C{Gadd9}I could make it high or \C{D}low
\C{Em}Sing it on the ra\C{G/B}dio
If \C{Cadd9}that is what I \C{G/B}need to do
\C{Eb(hold)}If a song could \C{D7(hold)}get me you

I could run for miles and miles
I'd take off and I'd start flying
I could cross land and sea
If you just believe me
I should not have hurt you so
This old house is not a home
Without you here, there's no use
I've got no time left to lose

So here it is, here it goes
I could try rock and roll
I would change your
life forever too
If a song could get me you
I could make it high or low
Sing it on the radio
If that is what I need to do
If a song could get me you\continuechords

\C{C}If a song could \C{G/B}get me through
I'd \C{Am}sing my way, right \C{Gadd9}back to you
\C{C}Tell me how, to \C{G/B}make it right
\C{Am}Tell me now, I'll \C{G/B}start tonight
I \C{C}know I could \C{G/B}make it last
I \C{D}swear to you that \C{C}if I knew
What I \C{G/B}was getting my\C{Em}self into
I \C{Am}wouldn't answer to my fears
I'd \C{C}never leave you s\C{D7}tanding there

Just \C{C}look at me\C{G/B}
\C{C} If you'd only see me
\C{Gadd9}I would prove my love for you
\C{Em}I could swallow half the moon
Just \C{D}tell me where, \C{C}tell me when
\C{D}I will have you \C{C}back again
