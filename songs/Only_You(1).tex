How can I forget you
The memories come and go
You're all I've ever wanted
You're all I've ever known
Can I be happy living with your ghost

The pictures tell the story
I took them off the wall
It's hard enough to get through
I still can't feel the fall
Do you even think of me at all

Oh I want you
Only you
And I want You
Only You

And I can't start it over
And find somebody new
A beautiful distraction
Just a hand to hold onto
But if you asked me if that love be true

No I want you
Only You
I want you
Only you

I want to taste you again
Like a secret or a sin
Breathing out breathing in
There's no one else for me

But you
Only you
And I want you
Only you
And I want you
Only you
I want you
Only you
And I want you
Only you
