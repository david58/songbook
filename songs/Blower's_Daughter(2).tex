And so it \C{E}is
Just like you said it\C{A\guitarFlat}{ }would be
Life goes eas\C{B\guitarFlat}y on me
\C{A\guitarFlat}Most of the\C{E}{}time
And \C{E}so it is
The shorte\C{A\guitarFlat}r story
No love, n\C{B\guitarFlat}o glory
No hero in \C{C\guitarSharp m}her sky

I can't \C{A}take my eyes off you
I can't \C{A\guitarFlat m}{take} my eyes off you
I can't \C{F\guitarSharp m}{take} my eyes off you
I can't \C{E}{take} my eyes off you
I can't \C{A\guitarFlat}{take} my eyes off\C{B\guitarFlat} you
I can't \C{A\guitarFlat}{take} my eyes... \C{A\guitarFlat B\guitarFlat E}

\C{E}And so it is
Just li\C{E}ke you said it sho\C{A\guitarFlat}uld be
We'll bo\C{A\guitarFlat}th forget the bree\C{A\guitarFlat}ze
\C{A\guitarFlat}Most of the \C{E}time
\C{E}And so it is
\C{E}The colder water \C{A\guitarFlat}
The blower's daughter \C{B\guitarFlat}
The pupil\C{C\guitarSharp m}{ }in denial

I can't \C{A\guitarFlat m}{take} my eyes off you
I can't \C{F\guitarSharp m}{take} my eyes off you
I can't \C{E}{take} my eyes off you
I can't \C{A\guitarFlat}{take} my eyes off\C{B\guitarFlat} you
I can't \C{A\guitarFlat}{take} my eyes... \C{A\guitarFlat B\guitarFlat E}
I can't \C{A\guitarFlat}{take}s my eyes...\C{-- B\guitarFlat}
