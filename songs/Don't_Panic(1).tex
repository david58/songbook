\C{Am}Oh, we're sinking like \C{C}stones
All that we \C{Fmaj7}{fought} for
All those places we've gone
All of us are done for\smallskip

\C{Dm}We live in a \C{Dm6}beautiful world \C{Am}
\C{G}Yeah we do, yeah we do
\C{Dm}We live in a \C{Dm6}{beautifu}l world \C{Fmaj7}

Oh, we're sinking like stones
All that we fought for
All those places we've gone
All of us are done for

We live in a beautiful world
Yeah we do, yeah we do
We live in a beautiful world

Oh, all that I know
There's nothing here to run from
And there, everybody here's got somebody to lean on
