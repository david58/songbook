\C{G}Oh \C{Em}no, I \C{Bm}see
\C{F}A spider web is \C{Am}tangled up with \C{G}me
\C{F}And I \C{Em}lost my \C{Bm}head
\C{F}And thought of all the \C{Am}stupid things I'd \C{G}said

Oh no, what's this?
A spider web and I'm caught in the middle
So I turn to run
And thought of all the stupid things I'd done

\C{A}And I never meant to cause you \C{Em}trouble
\C{A}I never meant to do you \C{Em}wrong
\C{A}And ah, well if I ever caused you \C{Em}trouble
\C{A}Oh, no I never meant to do you \C{Em}harm

Oh no, I see
The spider web and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
But here am I in my little bubble

Singing out
I never meant to cause you trouble
I never meant to do you wrong
And ah, well if I ever caused you trouble
Oh, no I never meant to do you harm

\C{Em}They \C{F\guitarSharp m}spun a \C{G}web \C{F\guitarSharp m}{ }for \C{Em}me
\C{Em}They \C{F\guitarSharp m}spun a \C{G}web \C{F\guitarSharp m}{ }for \C{Em}me
\C{Em}They \C{F\guitarSharp m}spun a \C{G}web \C{F\guitarSharp m}{ }for \C{Em}me
