\C{C}My song is \C{Am}{love} \C{G}
\C{C}Love to the \C{Am}{love}less \C{G}{shown}
\C{C}And it goes \C{Am}on \C{  ~~ G}
You don't \C{Dm}{have} to \C{C}be \C{G}{alone}

\C{C}Your heavy \C{Am}{heart} \C{G}
\C{C}Is made of \C{Am}{stone} \C{G F C}
\C{C}And it's so \C{Am}{hard} to \C{G}{see} clearly
\C{C}You don't \C{Dm}have to \C{C}be on your \C{G}{own}
You don't \C{F}{have} to be on your \C{G}{own}

\C{Dm}And I'm not gonna \C{C}take it \C{G}back
And I'm not gonna say, "I don't mean that"
You're a target that I'm aiming at
And I \C{Dm}get that \C{C}message \C{G}{home}

My song is love, my song is love, unknown
And I'm on fire for you, clearly
You don't have to be alone
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not gonna take it back
And I'm not gonna say, "I don't mean that"
You're a target that I'm aiming at
But I'm nothing on my own
Got to get that message home

\C{Dm - C - G (2x)}
And I'm not gonna stand and wait
Not gonna leave it until it's much too late, oh
On a platform, I'm gonna stand and then say
That I'm nothing on my own
And I love you, please come home

\C{F - C - G - Am (2x)}
My song is love, is love unknown
And I've got to get that message home
