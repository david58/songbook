\C{Intro 2x: Bm7 G D Dsus2}
\C{Bm7}Come up to \C{G}meet you
Tell you I'm \C{D}sorry
You don't know how \C{Dsus2}lovely you are
I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles
Calling tails
Heads on a silence apart

\C{G}Nobody said it was ea\C{D}sy
It's such a \C{Dsus2}shame for us to part
\C{G}Nobody said it was ea\C{D}sy
No one ever \C{Dsus2}said it would be this \C{A}hard
\C{A7}Oh, take me back to the \C{(D)}start

\C{D G D D}
\C{Bm7 G D Dsus2}
I was just guessing
At numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science
Science and progress
Did not speak as loud as my heart
Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
I want to rush to the start
Running in circles
Chasing tails
Coming back as we are
\Continue
Nobody said it was easy
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start
