\C{A}Honey \C{E}you are a \C{Bm}rock
\C{A}Upon \C{E}which I \C{Bm}stand
\C{A}And I \C{E}come here to \C{Bm}talk
\C{A}I hope \C{E}you \C{Bm}understand

The green eyes, yeah the \C{D}spotlight
Shines \C{A}upon \C{E}you
And \C{Bm}how \C{D}{could} \C{A}{anybody} deny \C{E}{you}

\C{Bm}I came here with a \C{D}load
And it feels so much \C{A}ligh\C{G}ter now i met \C{D}you
\C{Bm}And honey you \C{D}{should} know
That I could never \C{A}go \C{G}on without \C{D}you

\C{Bm}Green eyes

Honey you are the sea
Upon which I flow
And I came here to talk
I think you should know

The \C{Bm}green eyes
You're the \C{D}one that I wanted \C{A}to \C{E}find
And \C{Bm}anyone who tried to \C{D}deny you
Must be out of their \C{A}mind\C{E}

\continuechords
\C{Bm}Because I came here with a \C{D}load
And it feels so much \C{A}{ligh}\C{G}{ter} since I \C{D}met you
\C{Bm}And honey you should \C{D}know
That I could never \C{A}go \C{G}on \C{D}without you

The \C{Bm}green eyes, green eyes
Oh oh \C{A}oh, oh oh \C{Bm}oh, oh oh \C{A}oh, oh oh oh

Honey \C{E}you are a \C{Bm}rock
\C{A}Upon \C{E}{which} I \C{Bm}stand
